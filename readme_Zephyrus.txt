This package was created by the Zephyrus II CanSat team (Ioannina - Greece) for the CanSats in Europe 2018 Launch campaign.
Feel free to use it as you please for future missions.
A reference to our team is most welcome but not obligatory.

The package contains:
1.our source code for our flight module our payload and our groundstation with libraries.
 extra effort was taken in translating our rem inside the code since it was mostly Greek

2.our solidworks models
3. A calculations spreadsheet for data collected by our cansat
4. A spreadsheet with our calculation model for our descent
5.A list of commands for our cansat.
6.electrical diagramms for both our modules
